# calculator
This is a calculator web-app for The Odin Project - Foundations course.

The calculator will evaluate number pairs by a selected operator. Originally,
I planned to evaluate an array of value or a string, but for security reasons
the calculator will be limited to evaluating numbers in pairs and returning their
end value for the next operation.
